Welcome
======
I'm Ryan, a Ph.D. student in Computational Neuroscience at Boston University. Here you'll find my research work, projects, and thoughts on things that interest me.

My Science
======
As you can probably guess, I study the brain. My interests span a large variety of topics, but my current work focuses on two main areas: the develpment of novel state-space models for neural data analysis and the role of astrocytes in learning and memory. Specifically, I'm curious how astrocytes in the hippocampus work in tandem with neurons to form social memories. I am currently advised by [Dr. Brian DePasquale](https://depasquale-lab.github.io/), [Dr. Benjamin Scott](https://www.scottcognitionlab.com/), and [Dr. Steve Ramirez](https://theramirezgroup.org/).
