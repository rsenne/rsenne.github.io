excerpt: 'Engrams, or the physical substrate of memory, recruit heterogeneous cell types. Targeted reactivation of
neurons processing discrete memories drives the behavioral expression of memory, though the underlying
landscape of recruited cells and their real-time responses remain elusive. To understand how artificial stimulation of fear affects intra-hippocampal neuron-astrocyte dynamics as well as their behavioral consequences, we express channelrhodopsin-2 in an activity-dependent manner within dentate gyrus neurons while recording both cell types with fiber photometry in hippocampal ventral CA1 across learning and memory. Both cell types exhibit shock responsiveness, with astrocytic calcium events uniquely modulated by fear conditioning. Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampus-mediated engram recapitulates coordinated calcium signatures time locked to freezing, mirroring those observed during natural fear memory recall. Our findings reveal cell-type-specific dynamics in the hippocampus during freezing behavior, emphasizing neuronal-astrocytic coupling as a shared mechanism enabling both natural and artificially induced memory retrieval and the behavioral expression of fear.'
